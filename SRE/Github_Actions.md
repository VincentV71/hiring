# GitHub Actions Test for Solutions Architects

## General Instructions:
Please carefully read each question before starting.
Make sure to answer each question in the provided GitHub Actions workflow file.
Use only YAML syntax for all answers.
Ensure that your GitHub Actions workflow is functional and executes the expected tasks.
You can use online documentation and available resources to assist in problem-solving.

### Question 1: Workflow Trigger
Write a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically triggers on each push to the main branch of the repository.

Add a step to your GitHub Actions workflow to install the necessary dependencies for running the script `hello.py` (see exercises directory).


### Question 2: Secrets Management
Modify your GitHub Actions workflow to use GitHub secrets to store sensitive information.
Set a env var name `my_secret` and print this value (not a good practice !)

These questions cover various aspects of GitHub Actions workflows, including triggering, dependency installation, test execution, deployment to AWS, and secrets management. Make sure to provide functional and correct GitHub Actions workflows for each question.
